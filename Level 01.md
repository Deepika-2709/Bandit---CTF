# 🏁 Bandit Level 0 → Level 1

## 🛠️ Commands Used

### Step 1: Connect to the Bandit server
```bash
ssh bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220

### ✅ What this fixes
✔ Clearly explains **access credentials**  
✔ Properly documents **SSH usage**  
✔ Matches your **screenshot (level00.png)**  
✔ Clean Markdown for GitHub preview  

If you want, I can now:
- Rewrite **Level 1 → Level 2** in the same style  
- Standardize all levels into a **professional CTF report format**  
- Review your repo structure (`screenshots/`, `.md` naming, etc.)
