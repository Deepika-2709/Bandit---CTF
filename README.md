# Bandit CTF – Complete GitHub Repository Overview (Levels 0–34)

## 📌 Overview
Bandit is a beginner-friendly Linux wargame by **OverTheWire** designed to teach fundamental cybersecurity and command-line skills.  
Players connect to a remote server via SSH and solve progressively harder challenges by finding passwords stored in files, services, or binaries.

This repository documents **Bandit Levels 0–34** with explanations, commands, and concepts learned.

---

## 🎯 Purpose
The Bandit wargame helps learners:
- Gain confidence using the Linux terminal
- Understand file systems, permissions, and ownership
- Learn data encoding and compression techniques
- Practice networking and SSH-based attacks
- Build a foundation for Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges
- Prepare for platforms like TryHackMe and Hack The Box

---

## 🧠 Skills & Concepts Covered
- Linux navigation (`ls`, `cd`, `pwd`)
- File handling (`cat`, `less`, `file`)
- Hidden files and special filenames
- Permissions & ownership (`chmod`, `find`)
- Text processing (`grep`, `sort`, `uniq`, `awk`)
- Compression (`tar`, `gzip`, `bzip2`)
- Encoding & decoding (`base64`, `hex`, `ROT13`)
- Networking (`nc`, `telnet`, `openssl`)
- SSH keys and authentication
- Cron jobs and scripting basics
- Binary analysis and privilege escalation
